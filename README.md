# PRECIP Radar Scan (TW)

This project aims to help the radar operators to decide the RHI scan strategy (specifying the azimuths for RHI sectors) in a field campaign.

For now, specifically for PRECIP/TAHOPE field campaign (http://precip.org/), the notebook in this project pulls the latest radar image from CWB (https://www.cwb.gov.tw/V8/C/W/OBS_Radar.html), and plot azimuths centered at the specified radar location. For example, the S-PolKa planned to located at Hsin-Chu, Taiwan is specified in [SPOL_angles_TW.ipynb](https://github.com/yuhungjui/PRECIP_Radar_Scan_TW/blob/main/SPOL_angles_TW.ipynb).

The notebook is mainly modified from Dr. Rosimar Rios-Berrios's (NCAR) original notebook.
