# PRECIP Radar Scan (TW)

This project aims to help the radar operators to decide the RHI scan strategy (the azimuths for RHI sectors) in a field campaign.

Specifically for PRECIP/TAHOPE field campaign (http://precip.org/), the notebook in this project pulls the CWB latest radar image from https://www.cwb.gov.tw/V8/C/W/OBS_Radar.html, and plot azimuths from the specified radar location. For now, the S-PolKa planned to located at Hsin-Chu county is specified.

The notebook is mainly modified from Dr. Rosimar Rios-Berrios's (NCAR) original notebook.
